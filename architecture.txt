# AWS Architecture Components for ADP HR Dashboard Project

## Goal:
Allow HR to create, view, and share dashboards with managers.
Managers will receive email notifications when dashboards are shared.

## Key AWS Services Used:

1. API Gateway
   - Entry point for all API requests (e.g. Postman, or could be frontend)
   - Routes each request to the appropriate Lambda function

2. AWS Lambda
   - Hosts stateless backend logic for create, view, and share operations
   - `create_dashboard.py`, `view_dashboard.py`, and `share_dashboard.py` connect to DynamoDB and SNS
   - `email_dispatcher.py` is triggered by SNS and connects to **SendGrid** to send notification emails

3. DynamoDB
   - NoSQL database to store dashboard records
   - Holds fields like dashboard ID, name, metrics, created_by, and shared_with list

4. SNS (Simple Notification Service)
   - Publishes messages when a dashboard is shared
   - Triggers the `email_dispatcher.py` Lambda to handle notifications

5. Lambda (`email_dispatcher.py`)
   - Subscribed to the SNS topic
   - Receives dashboard_id and manager emails
   - Sends notification emails via **SendGrid** API (not via SNS or SES)

6. SendGrid (External)
   - Handles actual email delivery
   - Scales easily for 15,000+ recipients
   - Requires a verified sender and API key

7. CloudWatch
   - Logs all Lambda executions
   - Useful for debugging, monitoring, and tracking email success/failure
